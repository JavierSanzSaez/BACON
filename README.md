# BACON - A Beep Boop Beep for DeFi :bacon:
BACON is a Discord Bot designed to fulfill all my needs regarding Crypto and DeFi. This is mainly a project for fun, while at the same time it helps me keep an eye on Defi stats, such as coin prices.

# Installation
This project is based on the JS discord.js module, so you will need the basics:

```bash
sudo apt-get install nodejs npm
```
Fortunately all my dependencies are stored in [the package.json file](package.json), so you can easily install them:

```bash
npm install
```
